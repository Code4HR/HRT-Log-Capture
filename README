HRT Log Capture
================

This is a Java project which includes components for two essential use cases.

1.  The org.hrva.capture.Capture application to capture logs via tail, reformat and push.

2.  The org.hrva.capture.CouchPush application to push mappings.

These can be configured to populate http://hrt.iriscouch.com/feed database.
